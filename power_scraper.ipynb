    "## Code strategy\n",
    "We rely heavily on the `EntsoePandasClient` of the `entsoe` Python library, and its [query_generation_per_plant function](https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py/blob/e620357ad6ea0ddd217d4cff61eed18e8461f584/entsoe/entsoe.py#L905). Iterating over it for each country, and using a time interval from the beginning of the API's creation, to now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching web requests, saving completed country downloads, and progressbars is the glue that takes us all the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About web request caching\n",
    "We should avoid making web request to the API in order to avoid paing a cost of time and potentially getting rate limited or banned. To do this we can try to cache as much requests we make as possible, as the data isn't supposed to change anyhow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider us using the `query_generation_per_plant` function and passing a timespan of a week. I've learned it will make seven requests to the ENTSO-E API, one per day, because it is simply a restriction on their API. If we now specify overlapping days in a later request, these days will be cached and we will only probe the actual API with those that had not already been requested. All of this is done by us importing [requests-cache](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache) and saying we want to use it."
